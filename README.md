# HackCS TAU 2022 
A project created by our group using Monday's API for the annual CS hacathon in Tel Aviv University.
We created a system that allows the user to browse and search the courses in the "Sha'ar rooach" (שאר רוח) 
programm over monday's platform' helping students make smarter choices as to which courses 
should they take.

The programm scrapes the University's courses websites and accumaltes the data on the courses from them. Then,
it stores that data using GraphQL and dislplays it using Mondays API.
